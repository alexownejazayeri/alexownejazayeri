I narrowly avoided death-by-giant-tree-limb and committed to #100DaysOfCode. Now I'm working to become a dev (and eating dumplings...still).

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: JavaScript, React, [my #100DaysOfCode story](https://github.com/alexownejazayeri/100-days-of-code/blob/master/hello-world.md), what to buy at Trader Joe's
- ðŸ“« Say hello: [@alexjazayeri](https://twitter.com/alexjazayeri)
- âš¡ Fun facts: I've escaped a flash flood with a broken ankle and I brew that sweet, sweet booch.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the job search. Constructive feedback welcome.
